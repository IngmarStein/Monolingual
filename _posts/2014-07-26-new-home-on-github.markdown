Monolingual has moved from SourceForge to GitHub. The source code and website have already made the jump, the older downloads may follow soon. The forum and mailing lists probably won't be migrated.

In other news, the next major version of Monolingual (1.6.0) will require OS X 10.10.
It is currently being rewritten in Swift and other new technologies and will be released in time for Yosemite.
