Monolingual 1.3.2 has been released with the following changes from 1.3.1:

- Fixed an infinite loop if "/" is added to the directory list.
- Removing architectures is now much faster.
- Universal binaries containing only a single architecture are now converted to non-univeral binaries, saving some more space.
- Several bugfixes.
- Added a "Donate" menu item.
